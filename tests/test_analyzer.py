    great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No
    one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
    pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
    rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again
    is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of
    itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur
    in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a
    trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
    exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right
    to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no
    annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no
